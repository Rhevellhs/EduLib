Library System Management - SDG 4 (Quality Education)
Libraries play a crucial role in providing access to knowledge, research materials, and educational resources. However, traditional library management methods, such as book tracking, often lead to inefficiencies and data loss when handling large volumes of books. This challenge becomes even more complex as the number of students increases across different educational levels, including middle schools, high schools, and universities. Each level of education has distinct library management needs, whether in terms of book collections, borrowing systems, or access to digital learning resources.

To address these challenges, a solution that accommodates the needs of every educational level is essential. Therefore, the Library Management System (LMS) is designed as a software solution to efficiently manage library resources. LMS helps librarians track book collections, facilitate book lending, and generate reports that can enhance the effectiveness of library management. By adopting LMS, libraries in middle schools, high schools, and universities can be better organized, reduce the risk of data loss, and provide an improved experience for users in accessing various literary resources.
